# AI-Based-Face-Mask-Detection
An AI-based face mask detection project using Google Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js involves training a model to detect face masks in real-time through a web application. The model is trained on images of people wearing and not wearing masks and can be used in various settings to enforce mask-wearing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic.
