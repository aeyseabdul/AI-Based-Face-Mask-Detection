# AI-Based-Face-Mask-Detection
An AI-based face mask detection project using Google Teachable Machine with TensorFlow.js involves using machine learning to train a model to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask in real-time. The project utilizes Google Teachable Machine, a user-friendly platform for creating custom machine learning models, and TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in web browsers. The model is trained on a dataset of images of people wearing and not wearing face masks, and is then deployed to a web application where it can detect face masks in live video streams or images. This project can be used in various settings such as public places, offices, and schools to help enforce mask-wearing guidelines and promote safety during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
